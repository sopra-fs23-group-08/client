Yuker Tuker-Client

## Introduction
Yuker Tuker is an exciting and competitive game that allows players to compete against each other in guessing a random YouTube video from a selected playlist, using a similar logic to poker. This is the front-end component of our project. The back-end part can be found [here](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-08/server).


## Technologies
The JavaScript-written front end of this project uses the React framework. Persistence is managed through JPA/Hibernate. Communication between the server and client is achieved through REST and websockets (SockJS), with the additional usage of the STOMP messaging protocol for websockets. <!-- # recheck  -->

We would like to thank our teaching assistant [Sheena Lang](https://github.com/SheenaGit) for her help throughout the semester. We also thank Youtube for providing its API, and to the game of poker for inspiring our idea. This semester has proven to be both challenging and intriguing, offering us valuable opportunities for growth, as we acquired extensive knowledge not only in coding but also in teamwork and project execution. Even though none of us are doing Informatics as a major, we appreciate the opportunity and the experience gained from this project.
